1,"This is a public service announcement.Despite all the drama of the debates; despite all thats at stake for the worlds security and stability; despite all the breathless coverage; this election is about as small as it gets.A little more than a month away from election day, what have we really debated through this long contest?We have dissected the midnight tweets of a delusional, failed businessman. We have watched in awe at his man-child tantrums and eruptions. We have investigated emails that the National Archives will never see. We have fretted about a candidates bacterial infection.Lets be honest. We have not debated war and peace, capitalism and socialism, or even surveillance and privacy. More than anything else, we have simply obsessed about the psychopathic freak show that is the Trump campaign.Let the historians of the future know that the great Trump-Clinton contest of 2016 was much like the famous Seinfeld pitch to NBC: its a show about nothing.In that sense, we have to recognize something profound about this point in time. The blame is not entirely on the candidates or the campaigns, or even on our own shallow nature.For this is an election at a time of relative peace and prosperity. Yes, its true: peace and prosperity. And our failure to admit the obvious is hurting our ability to sustain an adult conversation about our politics.If you havent already pressed the publish button on your comments below, or tweeted your outrage to the world, its time to consider the facts.Yes, of course there are unacceptable levels of gun violence and isolated acts of homegrown terrorism. And the squeeze on the middle class  as well as the gap between rich and poor  is a profound challenge to us all.But back in the Seinfeld era, our cities saw far higher murder rates. There were the large-scale terrorist attacks of Oklahoma City and the Atlanta Olympics, the first attack on the World Trade Center and the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.The first internet bubble created millionaires and billionaires overnight, while the manufacturing decline that began in the early 1980s continued to hollow out the rust belt.So we rolled into an election at the end of the 1990s that bears a remarkable similarity to this one: a contest between two candidates who thrilled nobody in particular.A wonkish Democrat who wasnt particularly good at retail politics, seeking a third term after a popular and charismatic president. A simplistic Republican gun-slinger who promised a return to the Reagan era of even greater wealth and military superiority. Reporters (including this one) considered which of the two they would rather share a beer with. Meanwhile younger voters thought both candidates were hopelessly irrelevant to their lives and tiresomely similar in their politics.Of course the political differences between George W Bush and Al Gore were obvious and catastrophically so. As we now know, within a year of taking office, President Bush had decided to invade Iraq  a decision almost unthinkable for a President Gore. With a Gore White House, the US would have led the world on climate change more than a decade before President Obama struck the Paris agreement.But back in 2000, at another time of relative peace and prosperity, it didnt seem to matter whether voters cast a few ballots for Ralph Nader or even got confused and chose Pat Buchanan. And so the infinitely wise supreme court decided the course of the planet on the basis of 537 votes in Florida.The Trump-Clinton election isnt like 2004: a contest about national security, playing out in the bloodbath of the Iraqi civil war, while Osama bin Laden was still at large. Its nothing like 2008: an election that unfolded as the economy plunged into freefall in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash of 1929.It may have some echoes of 2012, when a wealthy businessman who liked the idea of self-deportation went up against a mainstream Democrat on issues of gender equality. But that was a presidential re-election effort, and both the president and the economy were very far from where they are today.Today unemployment stands at 4.9%. Thats lower than it was during George W Bushs election in 1988, Clintons re-election in 1996, and Bushs re-election in 2004. Four years ago, as Obama ran for the second time, it was 7.8%.The only recent election with a lower rate: Bush v Gore in 2000, when unemployment was 3.9%.Household incomes surged 5.2% last year, the largest gain since records began in 1967. If incomes continue to grow this year, they will have made up all the lost ground since the Great Recession of eight years ago and will be close to the all-time high reached in  when else?  1999. Gas prices are lower than they were in the last two elections, and the presidents job approval ratings are above 50%.And while there are still thousands of US troops deployed across the world, not least in Afghanistan, combat deaths are a fraction of what they were in the last three presidential cycles.None of which is to say that this election should remain substance-free. After all, it certainly is not consequence-free. Donald Trumps election would throw the worlds economy and its security framework into disarray.There are many factors to blame for this Seinfeld election: the capitulation of responsible Republicans to an extremist fringe; the small-bore politics of campaign strategists in a divided nation; and of course the brain of the GOP nominee himself.But you should also blame our stubborn inability to recognize the relative peace and prosperity that exists today. Until we turn the page on our mindset of recession and war, we are condemning ourselves to an election that is entirely Trumped up.This is a public service announcement.Despite all the drama of the debates; despite all thats at stake for the worlds security and stability; despite all the breathless coverage; this election is about as small as it gets.A little more than a month away from election day, what have we really debated through this long contest?We have dissected the midnight tweets of a delusional, failed businessman.

2,"Yesterday morning at four o'clock the Joint Convention at Washington brought its labours conclusion, and Messrs Hayes and Wheeler were declared respectively President and Vice President of the Union by a majority of one vote over Messrs Tilden and Wheeler.The scene in the House of Representatives during the night exceeded in violence 'anything that has been seen since the war,' and the timely conclusion of the 'count' is largely due to the firmness of Speaker Randall, who refused at last to receive any more propositions involving delay.Mr Ferry, in receiving the announcement that the House was ready to join the Senate in completing the count, deprecated any partisan demonstration on an occasion 'so reputable to the American people and so worthy of the respect of the world.' The force of unconscious irony could no further go.AnalysisA much more important election than that on which we commented yesterday was being brought to a final issue at about the same time. If we look with interest to the struggle for a single seat in a Legislature of many hundred members, how much greater concern is justified when the political character of the whole Government is at stake?The entire executive of the United States, from the President down to the humblest subordinate, would according to custom, have gone out of office today if the popular choice had been declared to fall on the Democratic candidate for the Chief Magistracy.As it is, a certain number of not unimportant posts will change occupants; but by the acknowledged triumph of Mr Hayes the party which has held power for the last sixteen years will retain its supremacy.Were that all that is to be said, the popular mind of Amerce might well seem by comparison with anything we are accustomed to have been stirred to dangerous depths. But the full extent of the agitation to which it has been exposed can only be appreciated when we remember that this was the first occasion on which the contending parties had been brought face to face at the polling booths since they were engaged in civil war.The once 'solid South' is, of course, a thing of the past. It has not arms, it has not political organisation, it has not commercial influence, nor is even more than a fraction of the land which was its birthright in its possession. The shattered and dejected condition of the interest, formerly so powerful has therefore vastly simplified the recent contest by making the resumption of hostilities in the field manifestly impossible.On the other hand, since the restoration of the authority of the Union party lines have ceased to be coincident with geographical or territorial divisions. The remaining representatives of Southern rights have allies in every Northern state among large classes of the population who never yielded more than a grudging and temporary assent to the principles by the uncompromising assertion of which the confederacy was reduced to submission.As they can go tardily and on compulsion into opposition to the great recession movement, they have had to bear their share of the penalty involved in its defeat. It is these men, a part of every separate community in the Republic, and especially of the thriving commercial centre who have been straining every nerve for the recovery of the influence which they lost in the day of national convulsion.But a very few weeks ago, moreover, they not unreasonably faltered themselves with the belief that the prize which had so long been withheld from them was within their grasp. Hence the passion that has been thrown into later stages of the gradually narrowing struggle, which ends in their being repulsed when already within sight of the promised land.We need now only briefly refer to the circumstances which imparted so much animation to the conflict. The choice of the President for a term of four years is virtually involves in the nomination of the members returned to the Electoral College by the several states.When the appeal to the national constituency had been made in this form last autumn, it became evident that a nearer approach to a tie had been reached that the authors of the Constitution had thought to be probable.A very small number of votes turned one way or the other would determine the tenure of power, and more than a sufficient number of the nominal returns were disputed.To heighten the difficulty of finding a solution calculated to command universal assent it happened that, as the whole body of electors appeared to be not very unequally divided between Mr Tilden and Mr Hayes, so the Senate of Washington was Republican in its prevailing character, while the Democrats had a large majority in the House of Representatives.By the law the President of the Senate had the function of counting the votes cast for the President of the Republic, and it could not be denied that this duty included the power of deciding where there were double or disrupted returns which should be received.Mainly it was a question of whether the Returning Boards, notoriously partisan, of some three of four states of the Union had done rightly or wrongly in rejecting the votes of whole districts on the plea of fraud and intimidation.The Democrats, paramount in the House and assured that their party had obtained an effectual majority at the poll, were unwilling to trust the adjudication upon the returns to an officer who, as President of the Senate as well as from personal prediction, was believed to incline strongly towards the other side.The force of the objection was admitted by agreeing to refer the consideration of the course which should be taken to a Joint Committee of the two branches of the Legislature, and on the proposal of this committee the delicate task of counting the votes was ultimately assigned to a High Commission specially constituted for the purposes.Five members nominated by the Senate, five by the House of Representatives, and five of the principle judges sat upon this tribunal. So far all seemed to promise harmony; but the impression was fated soon to be destroyed.It became speedily evident that the High Commission by a constant majority of one exactly - corresponding with the preponderance of Republicans over Democrats on the board - were bent upon reckoning all the returns made in favour of Mr Hayes without even feigning to inquire into their legal validity.So soon as the political relations between the voters and the presidential candidate were reversed its principle of procedure. When this was seen, the extreme Democrats, perceiving that all was lost if the process were continued, endeavoured to fall back on tactics of delay. If the completion of the counting of the votes could be postponed until after the 4th of March President Grant's term of office would expire, his successor not having, however, been appointed.A Bill hastily passed by the House, and supplementing or affirming constitutional arrangements already alleged to exist, provided that in this case the office should be filled by a temporary substitute, and that a fresh appeal to the country should be made with the least possible loss of time.During the last few days it has been the strenuous endeavour of the more intractable spirits of the party by means of all the articles which constitutional forms allow to be employed to bring about this conjuncture.The telegrams describe the wild scenes of excitement provoked by these persistent efforts. More temperate counsels, however prevailed; and the speaker having at length refused to put any more simply obstructive motions, the fiery opposition yielded, and in a joint session of both Houses the final success of Mr Hayes was proclaimed.The American people are no doubt to be congratulated on having again saved their system of government from risks to which many more carefully devised constitutions have succumbed. In this general sense the claim which the President of the Senate asserts on behalf of the proceedings of the last month to 'merit the respect of the world' will be ungrudgingly allowed.We may venture to doubt, however, whether the praise is due to the national character as a whole will be doomed to be equally divided between the political parties. The Republicans have achieved the immediate victory which they determined to gain at all hazards; but they have purchased it at a heavy cost.There is no manner of doubt that the High Commission was intended to make an intelligent and impartial scrutiny into the character of the returns, and that the powers which it possessed would have been delegated to it on no other understandings. It is equally notorious and plain that by the common admission of friends and foes the honest prosecution of this inquiry was expected to show that Mr Tilden was the popular choice.The best that the more scrupulous supporters of Mr. Hayes can say in defence of the advantage of which they avail themselves is that no one could have foreseen what would happen, and that the undertaking to submit to the award of the Tribunal, though the expressed engagement on which it was given has been violated, cannot now be withdrawn.A President who comes into office on such conditions is not to be felicitated on the prospect before him. The true credit for saving the country from worse disorder, perhaps even from civil convulsion, is due to the patience and self control which the majority of the Democrats have displayed from the beginning of the struggle to its close.Such qualities show that the discipline of long suffering has not been thrown away upon them; and that proof is the best assurance of their growing strength. They have learnt loyalty to law in the school of adversity, and they will not go unrewarded.Nothing promises better then their recent action to confirm the hold they have already gained on the confidence of the country, and secure them at no distant date a long tenure of power.",2
3,"There is often a heartless contradiction between American ideals and the general willingness to accept them in action. Mr. Truman's biography is the stuff of which all Presidents are supposed to be made. It is the character and career party campaign handbooks attribute to their chosen leader. It is on file in every Hollywood studio, heading the category of thoroughly reliable ""characters"" whom not even the House Un-American Activities Committee would question. It is described in the schools as the very root and flower of what is best about the American way of life. Yet it appears uneasily in the White House as is remembered as the object of characteristic jokes. Coolidge's memory is green in the popular recollection for his cracker-barrel cynicism and his opposition to sin. And now we are ready to recall 'to err is to Truman' and ""Don't shoot the piano-player, he's doing his best.""Yet the fame of the Truman Investigating Committee was justly earned: it wrote the most searching and sympathetic record of a war Administration's blunders and successes. Mr. Truman's history in the Senate was that of an alert debater, a practical humanitarian, a courageous New Dealer from a state festering with political corruption which never tainted his personal history. Many a more pretentious statesman would have quietly forgotten his machine connections when that machine was exposed and punished in the law courts. But to Harry Truman it was a simple courtesy to leave Washington and his new glory as Vice-President and go home to Missouri to attend the funeral of the squalid Boss Pendergast, who came out of goal to die. Pendergast had picked Truman as his man for the Senate, and Mr. Truman came from the sort of people who despise a man who forgets a favour. Truman had come up the ""folksy"", traditional way of the machine politician - a road overseer, farm-tax collector, a bridge-mender, a drainer of dirt roads after heavy rains, then a postmaster, a club organiser, then tedious nights learning enough law to justify his election as a county court judge. But he knows as well as most that it is also the hard way. At various times he had gone into debt and worked at all sorts of jobs because the convention of going bankrupt was odious to him. ""He ploughed the straightest line of corn in Jackson County,"" his mother kept on telling reporters. To Harry Truman the moral implications of that compliment are as binding as the words of a Methodist hymnal. Being present at Pendergast's funeral was an obvious duty.INEPTITUDEIt is, I think, the acting out of such straightforward maxims in a great office that requires tact, timing and a goodly gloss of two-facedness which has bewildered Mr. Truman and made his administration in the end admittedly inept. When the late Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, made a speech in Boston and, with Roosevelt's private approval, came out for Atlantic convoys for British shipping, the grateful cries of Englishmen were as loud as the screams of protest over here. Questioned a press conference, Mr. Roosevelt said surely Mr. Knox had a right to speak for himself. Truman would have told all, as he did over the misbegotten plan to woo Stalin with Justice Vinson. When he was a haberdasher he bought at boom prices and sold at depression prices. His shop failed, but he is not a despondent man and one can admire the sigh and the plucky grin with which he has, throughout his life, tried to learn from his mistakes. Unfortunately it is too late to learn in the White House, and Americans who admire the hard-luck story in their neighbour will not tolerate it when the that neighbour is raised to ""the elective kingship.""The failure of President Truman cannot be called a failure of principle or even a betrayal of the programme he inherited. The things he has genuinely wanted to have done have been every bit as New Deal as Roosevelt. In one proposal, the uncompromising for a federal fair employment code, he went headily beyond even Roosevelt's boldness. And of all the campaigns his has made the most sense as merely the politics of survival. While Governor Dewey has promised ""a firm hand on the tiller"" and ""a rudder to our ship."" Truman has been talking about the need for veterans' housing, about drastic enlargements of the social security and sickness insurance programmes, about federal ownership of transmission lines, about the Taft-Hartley Act, about inflation, about longer terms for the Atomic Energy Commission.UNIMPRESSIVEBut there are over sixty million Americans at work. In this time of deceptive prosperity, Mr. Truman's voice sounded somewhat hollow as he went on asking for the things that the country was ready to accept in a depression. The recoil against the New Deal is too easily interpreted abroad as a positive reaction against liberal reform. There is enough evidence in the fight for Senate seats, and in the good showing of unrepentant New Dealers even in states where Dewey will be chosen, to show that if an impressive man is spouting the New Deal doctrine he will be heeded. But Mr. Truman is by now worse than unimpressive. He has committed the unwritten, un-American crime of being out-smarted. When he took the oath of office he was helped along by the legendary assumption that, when all is said and done, homespun men are the shrewdest. His early press conferences gave pause to this comfortable notion. He made impulsive answers that had to be corrected later. The episode of Wallace's dismissal, demanded by the Secretary of State, was only the first of the rude disillusions.It will not do to say that greatness is lacking. Very few Presidents have had any claim on it. But mediocre Presidents must depend on careful advice and preserve in public the appearance of authority. Mr. Truman surrounded himself partly with sincere political hacks and made impressive military men substitute for the grand fa_ade he lacked. This latter has been the most interesting and could be the most serious fault in his conception of the President's office. It has puzzled many who would expect so humble a man to be uncomfortable in the presence of so much big brass. It seems to be, however, a true character trait. As a small boy he was ""mercifully ridiculed"" in school for reading books from choice and, what is worse, taking piano lessons. He made up for the ridicule by boning up, in stealth, on military history. He amazed the town by applying for, and winning a place at West Point. Then he was turned down on account of bad eyesight. It must have been a shocking blow. He has revealed throughout his administration a fearful respect for the judgement of military men. And, by the same mechanism of wistful envy, the Truman doctrine was conceived the day he sat at Fulton, Missouri, in the immense shadow of Churchill.",3
4,"Ninety concentrated minutes of gritty legal argument, spiced with high constitutional theory, held much of America spellbound yesterday as lawyers for George W Bush and Al Gore battled for the hearts and minds of the nine members of the US supreme court in the decisive showdown of the presidential election dispute.As the court grappled head-on for the first time in its history with a case in which it may decide who becomes the nation's president, the justices peppered the rival candidates' lawyers with questions which were instantly seized upon for clues about the way the court was moving.When the time-limited oral arguments were over, chief justice William Rehnquist and his eight colleagues withdrew to discuss their ruling. There was no immediate indication of when they would announce their verdict, though today is the deadline for Florida to nominate its 25 members of the electoral college. The college is legally bound to meet in all 50 states next Monday, December 18, to choose between Mr Bush and Mr Gore.At issue for the court was Mr Bush's complaint that the Florida supreme court had overstepped its authority, threatening ""irreparable harm"" to his rights, when it ordered a complete count of previously excluded ""undervotes"" in the November 7 election. If the court upholds Mr Bush's complaint, as it did when it stopped the count last Saturday, Mr Gore's chances of winning the presidency will probably be at an end. If the court orders that the count can go on, then the outcome remains in doubt.Many observers believed that the court was likely to split 5-4, as it did on Saturday.The focus was on the two justices whose votes are normally crucial in deciding the majority line in the court and who, even more than their seven more predictable colleagues, held the historic outcome in their hands.Both justice Sandra Day O'Connor and justice Anthony Kennedy were quick to join the argument yesterday, quizzing Mr Bush's lawyer Ted Olson about everything from dimpled chads to the fundamentals of the US constitution.""Where's the federal question here?"" Mr Kennedy asked, boosting Mr Gore's supporters who hoped the court would rule that the Florida outcome was a matter for the local state courts to decide.""What standard did the secretary of state set?"" Ms O'Connor asked, triggering speculation that some judges might be thinking of allowing the count to resume under more tightly written guidelines for ascertaining the voter's intention on the state's 40,000 disputed ""undervotes"" on which Mr Gore's slim hopes rest.Five miles away in his official residence, Mr Gore was preparing to do what many of his fellow citizens did yesterday - settle down to listen to audio tape of the proceedings being broadcast on many television and radio channels. Three of Mr Gore's children joined his campaign manager, Bill Daley, in the courtroom itself.Mr Bush was 1,500 miles away in Austin, working in the Texas governor's office as the court began to discuss his electoral fate.""I am keeping my emotions in check,"" Mr Bush told reporters as he arrived at work. ""I am making a statement once we determine what the outcome of the supreme court decision is and we'll see what happens,"" he added.",4
5," One week has now passed since the Supreme Court ruled against racial segregation in the public schools. No firm conclusion can yet be formulated but certain clear guides to the country's acceptance of the verdict have already become visible. There is an overwhelming sentiment, in the South as well as in the North and among whites as well as Negroes, that the Supreme Court upheld the true meaning of American democracy in its verdict. Countless newspapers and leaders of public opinion have made the point summarised by the ""New York Times"" to-day when it said that the Court's decision ""will not merely ease the burden of a single racial minority; we are all of us a little stronger and more confident because of it. The future of this field will not be easy. But out of the struggle for righteousness comes the lasting glory of nations.""Five RulesIn Washington, meanwhile, plans are going ahead to make this city, in accordance with President Eisenhower's wishes, the model of the non-segregated system for the entire country. Yesterday, a committee of the District Board of Education adopted these five rules:1. Pupils will not be favoured of discriminated against because of race or colour; 2. School boundaries when reorganised will be honoured with few exceptions, but no exceptions will be made for reasons of race; 3. After June 17 records of pupils and school personnel will be kept without reference to race; 4. The physical school plant will be utilised fully without regard to race; 5. All appointments, changed assignments, promotions, and annual ratings of educational and other employees will be based on merit and not on race or colour.The schools superintendent, Mr Corning, who at first was opposed to early action, has accepted these principles. He will present a detailed plan for a unified school system to the Board of Education on Tuesday.Over the week-end Negro leaders of eighteen Southern and border states met in Atlanta, Georgia, at a conference called by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People. Mr Channing Tobias, the association's president, urged the conference to remember that patience and co-operation must be the watchword of Negro action while the difficult problems attending compulsory segregation are being solved. He added: ""Let it not be said of us that we took advantage of a sweeping victory to drive hard bargains or impose unnecessary hardship upon those responsible for working out the details of adjustment.""",5
6,"The Dallas shootings exposed an ugly faultline in American politics that threatens to run all the way to Novembers presidential election, already one of the most polarised in memory.For the second time in a month, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were forced to call off campaign events, just as they did after the mass shooting in Orlando by a man claiming allegiance with Islamic State. Both candidates now find themselves in a febrile political atmosphere around policing, gun control and race.Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, has pitched himself as a tough-on-crime candidate and previously claimed he will impose the death penalty for anyone convicted of killing a police officer. His Democratic rival Clinton, like Barack Obama, has repeatedly called for tighter gun control and reform of a criminal justice system that unfairly targets African Americans.If the 2016 election will be a reflection of a divided nation, race is demonstrably a facet of that. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that Clinton has a 79% favourability rating among African Americans, while Trump has a 94% unfavourability rating.Police in Dallas said one of the suspects stated that he wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers. Just as after the violence in Ferguson, Missouri, after the killing of black teenager Michael Brown by a white officer, the response quickly turned toxic in rightwing media, with Obama accused of waging a war on police.A host on the conservative Fox News asked guests if this weeks killings of African Americans Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota had received too much media coverage.Derek Harvey, a former US army colonel and senior intelligence executive for the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Fox News that the Black Lives Matter movement and others have been routinely calling for the deaths of police officers and inciting people to violence.He insisted: Black Lives Matter is not blameless in this situation, and even compared its use of messaging on the internet with Isis.Corey Stewart, the Trump campaigns state chairman in Virginia, wrote on Facebook: Liberal politicians who label police as racists  specifically Hillary Clinton and Virginia Lt Governor Ralph Northam  are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officers tonight. He later deleted the post. The Trump campaign disavowed it.And former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, now a radio host, reportedly tweeted: This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you. The post has also since been deleted.A Black Lives Matter account on Twitter posted: #BlackLivesMatter advocates dignity, justice and freedom. Not murder.Trump has not been slow to exploit past political opportunities, including the Orlando massacre, and can be expected to accuse of Clinton of being anti-police, soft on crime and blinded by political correctness when he next makes a stump speech.In a statement on Friday, he condemned a coordinated, premeditated assault on the men and women who keep us safe and said we must restore law and order, although he did also comment: The senseless, tragic deaths of two motorists in Louisiana and Minnesota reminds us how much more needs to be done.Trump later corrected his statement on Facebook to acknowledge that Sterling was not in fact a motorist.In a thinly veiled attack on Obama, Trump, who had been due to address Hispanic voters in Miami, added: Our nation has become too divided. Too many Americans feel like theyve lost hope. Crime is harming too many citizens. Racial tensions have gotten worse, not better. This isnt the American Dream we all want for our children.Clinton had been due to share a platform on Friday with Joe Biden in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and address the killings of Sterling and Castile by demanding urgent reform to our broken criminal justice system, according to an aide.In an interview with CNNs Wolf Blitzer, she emphasised the need to respect and support the police but also did not shy away from criticising systematic racism in some of the countrys 18,000 police forces against people of colour.I would call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African American families who fear every time their children go somewhere, who have to have the talk about how to really protect themselves when they should be being protected, Clinton said. Im going to be talking to white people; I think were the ones who have to listen to the legitimate cries coming from our African American neighbours.Gun violence, and its effect on black communities, has been a major theme of the Clinton campaign and may be part of her offensive against Trump. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said: This latest mass shooting is another example of how guns in the hands of dangerous people tear families and communities apart.Clintons response to the deadliest attack on police since 9/11 is also likely to be seen through the prism of the White House. She appeared alongside Obama for the first time at a campaign event this week and her closeness to him can be both a strength and weakness. Americas first black president comes under unique scrutiny on the issue of police shootings and their racial dimension.In 2013, following the fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighbourhood watch volunteer, Obama memorably said: If I had a son, hed look like Trayvon. He was criticised by some for being too emotionally involved.In cases involving police brutality, he has had to walk a fine line, condemning persecution of minorities while also praising the dedication of most officers. The White House regularly has to deny the existence of so-called Ferguson effect that allegedly deters police from intervening and leads to a spike in crime.Now inside the last 200 days of his presidency, Obama has admitted that he feels at liberty to speak more freely and be less circumspect.Initially, arriving in Warsaw, Poland, for his last Nato summit, Obama gave his response to the deaths of Sterling and Castile. [T]hese are not isolated incidents, he said. Theyre symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system. ... Weve got to tackle those things.Hours later, the president returned to condemn the vicious, calculated and despicable attack on Dallas police and added carefully: Lets be clear there are no possible justifications for these attacks or any violence towards law enforcement.Obama added pointedly: Even as yesterday I spoke about our need to be concerned, as all Americans, about racial disparities in our criminal justice system, I also said yesterday that our police have an extraordinarily difficult job and the vast majority of them do their job in outstanding fashion.¡¨But he was probably less surprised than anyone when opponents sought to put the blame on him. ",6
7,"Bob Woodward said yesterday for the first time (that is, it's the first time anyone has said it, not the first time Bob Woodward has said it) that the idea of a Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton ticket in 2012, long a subject of idle speculation among my sort, has actually been discussed in the higher precincts. The notion is that Clinton and Joe Biden would switch jobs. Politico's Laura Rozen picked this up:""It's on the table,"" veteran Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward told CNN's John King in an interview Tuesday on John King, USA. ""Some of Hillary Clinton's advisers see it as a real possibility in 2012.""Now. ""On the table"" could mean that it's some fantasy of Mark Penn's, and he's the only guy talking it up. So keep that caveat in mind. But basically, this is actually a rather excellent idea  for four very compelling reasons.First, Clinton brings more excitement and razzle-dazzle to a re-election effort that, even assuming a by-then-improved economy, will be tough sledding. She would help rev up women and Latinos, and she's raise the comfort level on a second Obama term inside the Beltway establishment, which generally speaking likes her a lot and consider the Potus a little unproven as yet.Second, Biden has always wanted to be secretary of state and would probably be a perfectly good one. One pictures him picking up the baton from HRC without much trouble or interference.And here's good reason 2a with a bullet: Biden over the years has had an especially strong relationship with Bibi Netanyahu, despite their many policy differences. It's long been said that Netanyahu thinks Biden shoots the straight stuff. If Bibi is still prime minister, Biden could make some real progress with him.Third, it tees Clinton up to run for president in 2016 if they win in 2012. If elected, she'd be the same 69 when sworn in that Ronald Reagan was. That may or may not be reassuring depending on your perspective, but it certainly makes it hard for conservatives, who have beatified Reagan and his presidency, to argue that she's too old (although they undoubtedly will, also undoubtedly finding some sexist angle that it matters more because she's a woman).Anyway, she seems to me the obvious Democratic choice for 2016. Assume for the sake of argument that Obama is re-elected (which, interestingly, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger just said he foresaw as a pretty obvious outcome; isn't it about time he just became an independent?). There aren't really any young star Democrats coming up who have a lot of sizzle, and Democrats and some (enough) independents might be ready in 2016, having knocked down the race barrier, to take a hammer to the gender one.Fourth, and maybe most interestingly, it actually helps an administration, in inside-baseball terms, especially within one's own party, to have a vice-president who is the presumptive heir and nominee. Biden would not seek the presidency, presumably. That would mean that in 2014 and 2015, if he were still the veep, you'd have a dozen or so Democrats in congress angling to run for president who'd be crapping on the White House when they considered it expedient to do so.This happened to Bush with Cheney in the veep's chair, with regard to Iraq, Katrina, spending and other things. A sort of sub-narrative developed in the media in those days about how so-and-so, Huckabee or Romney or whomever, could differentiate himself from Bush. I think it helped weaken the Bush White House's position. Certainly, by 2007, Bush was, though still president, yesterday's news: a very lame duck indeed.That was, of course, more because of his comic approval ratings than anything else. Still, if you have a presumptive nominee as your vice-president, that kind of intra-party preening is largely a waste of time (question: if Bush had cashiered Cheney for Mitt Romney in 2004, would Obama be president today?). Plus, the White House still has ¡V forgive me for employing one of those Beltway phrases I don't really like ¡V skin in the game. It has a much more real stake in electing the next president than a White House with a Cheney-Biden type figure.The trick for all involved, of course, is to deny it, deny it, deny it ¡V until the day they do it. But do it they should, when the time is right. ",7
8,"This was the United States' day in the Olympic Games.Five finals were decided, and they won four of them, the 400 metres hurdles, 800 metres, long jump and the women's 100 metres. Germany, who also had one glorious moment when they thought that their long jump champion was going to tie with the invincible Jesse Owens, won the women's discus the fifth event.Of the other teams, Canada did splendidly with a second in the 400 metre hurdles, a third in the 800 metres, and three men in the last twelve for the 200 metres. Poland, Italy, Japan, and the Philippines all had cause for satisfaction; not so Great Britain, who had their third unhappy day in succession.None of our 200 metres or long jumpers survived the preliminary stages. We had, however, one gain of consolation at the end of the day in the 5,000 metre heats, in which F. Close and P. D. Ward qualified for the final. Ward in particular running with calmness and good sense, which were most reassuring.The breaking of records continues being broken. The old Olympic records were beaten by three men and equalled by two more in the long jump, beaten twice by one man (Owens) and equalled by two more in the 200 metres.Two women in the discus and two women in the 100 metres again beat it. It becomes increasingly obvious that the general standard of the competitors is far higher in these games than it has ever been before, even at Los Angeles.SWEENEY IN STRONG HEATThe sprinters were set to run the first round of the 200 metres at the cheerless hour of 10 30 a.m. and in the first heat Van Beveren (Holland) gave the Americans something to think about by winning by seven yards in 21.4 seconds. Some nine yards behind him our own champion, A. W. Sweeney, was struggling gamely in a field which was out of his class.Like Evenson yesterday in the steeplechase, he had happened to strike a heat, which was much stronger than any other, and though he did 21.9 seconds. This was a fifth of a second better than Pennington's time and faster than twelve of the 24 men who qualified for the next round, he finished only fourth and was eliminated.Owens was at the long jump pit, and a few seconds later a great roar of admiration from the crowd announced that one jump had been sufficient to qualify him for the final.Altogether sixteen men jumped the qualifying distance of 23 ft and 5 inches and our two representatives were among them.The finalists consisted of three Americans, two Japanese, two Italians, one Czech, one Frenchman, one Swede, one Norwegian, one Brazilian and one Canadian. This last being Sammy Richardson, the young Negro, who as a schoolboy won the Empire Games long jump in London two years ago.THE FINAL JUMPThe long jump final was prodigious. When the best six started their final jumps Jesse Owens, with 25 ft and 9 inches was just one inch ahead of long (Germany), and in the next round Long drew exactly level with him, doing incidentally the biggest jump ever done by a European.But there the excitement ended, for Owns settled the matter by jumping 26 ft and 5.31 inches. Exactly one centimetre covered third, fourth and fifth men.The first semi-final of the 400 metres hurdles was a stirring race, and at halfway the two Americans, Hardin and Schofield, were leading, with White (Philippines) third, and Mantikas (Greece) sixth and last.Hardin went on his way untroubled, and White, a dark sturdy runner, was second without much trouble, but nobody looked at either of them, for Mantikas was coming through the field behind like a runaway train. Two yards from the finish he caught the flagging Schofield and had just manage to push his chest in front before he dropped exhausted on the track.They were so close that the judges refused to award the third place until they had seen a photograph of the finish. In the other semi-final Patterson (United States) was always ahead, and Loaring (Canada) made sure of a place in the final by running splendidly in the second half of the race.In the final Patterson, in the inside lane led for the first half of the race, with Hardin, Loaring, and White close up and going easily. Round the last bend Patterson began to flag and Hardin to put on the pace.Hardin was a yard ahead over the last hurdle and then he began to run and left the others standing.Loaring, White, and Patterson came over the last hurdle dead level, but once more Loaring's grand finish stood him in good stead and beat White by a long yard for second place. Mantikas was unable to show any sort of form after his tremendous effort in the semi-final. ",8
9,"Moments after Michael Phelps walked into his press conference he pulled a mobile phone from his pocket and began to take pictures of the crowd in front of him. ""Why not?"" he asked as a ripple of laughter spread through the throng of journalists and cameramen. ""You guys are all taking pictures of me.""Phelps's career has just days to run. He is adamant that he will retire after the Games, and he is trying to savour every second of the last of his four Olympics. ""These are the last competitive moments that I will have in my career,"" he said. ""It's big. There are going to be a lot of firsts and a lot of lasts this week. I won't be holding back when I am in the pool.""No one ever got rich betting against Phelps, now 27, but some wonder whether he still has the motivation needed. His team-mate Tyler Clary has said as much. ""Basically, he was a swimmer that didn't want to be there,"" he said after seeing Phelps in training. ""They can talk about all of these goals and plans and preparation they have. I saw it. I know. It's different. And I saw somebody that has basically been asking to get beat for the longest time.""Clary has since apologised to Phelps and the rest of the USA swimming team, but there may be something in what he said. Phelps has admitted that his priorities are a little different this time around. In Beijing he had been trying to conquer ""everything and anything"", but this, he says, ""is the closure. And it is really how many toppings do I want on my sundae? That's what I am doing"".He has, it would be fair to say, a warped sense of how to treat himself.Phelps is competing in seven events here, and his programme begins on Saturday night with one of the most keenly anticipated races in the history of Olympic swimming ¡V the showdown with his team-mate Ryan Lochte in the 400m individual medley.They race twice this week, in the 400m and 200m medleys, competing for the title of the world's best all-round swimmer. ""I don't know how you decide who is the world's greatest swimmer,"" Lochte says, modestly. Other people do. Great Britain's James Goddard, who will most likely be one of the men trailing in the wake of Phelps and Lochte and racing for the bronze, said: ""Those two are the greatest swimmers of all time, and I'm honoured that I am swimming in this event."" In Goddard's opinion Phelps is ""the best athlete who has ever walked the planet, in any sport"". Phelps needs three medals to become the most-decorated Olympian in history, overtaking the Russian gymnast Larisa Latynina. He should do it easily.Even the greatest of all time have their limits, though. After Beijing Phelps swore he would never compete in the 400m medley again, because it is so gruelling. And yet here he is.""It is going to be a coach's dream, and it is going to be a spectator's dream,"" says Phelps's coach, Bob Bowman, of this race. ""But it isn't a swimmer's dream."" Lochte beat him in this event at the US trials, but Phelps says he has shaken off the rust he thinks cost him that race.Even as Phelps is getting ready to leave the stage, his team-mate Missy Franklin is stepping into it to take his place in the limelight. The 17-year-old will swim in seven events at these Olympics. She was only six when Phelps, then 16, won his first world championship title in 2001. She more than matched that feat at her own world championship debut last year, when she won three golds and two bronzes. Wide-eyed and open-minded, Franklin seems to be constantly overwhelmed with excitement at the situation she finds herself in. ""It has been so much fun,"" she gushed. ""I was bouncing off the walls and giving everyone hugs when I got my uniform."" She too will be in the pool on Saturday night, swimming in the final of the 4x100m freestyle.Phelps, the sage old hand, warned her that she will need to keep her emotions under control. ""This week will be a completely different experience for her,"" he said. If he had one key piece of advice for her though, it would be this: be yourself.""I want to be the first Michael Phelps,"" he added. ""That's what I always wanted to do and that's what I will continue to try to do."" The first and only. Catch him while you still can. ",9
10," An early morning confrontation between two groups of Northern Arizona University students escalated into a shooting that left one student dead and three more injured, campus police said on Friday.An 18-year-old NAU student, identified as freshman Steven Jones, was taken into custody after allegedly killing one student and injuring three others outside of a fraternity dormitory, NAU police chief Gregory T Fowler said during a press conference on Friday morning.NAU president Rita Cheng called the shooting isolated and unprecedented speaking at the press conference.This is not going to be a normal day at NAU, she told reporters and students on Friday morning. Our hearts are heavy.The university named the four victims.Colin Brough, a Freshman at the university, was killed.Nicholas Prato, Kyle Zientek and Nicholas Piring are being treated at Flagstaff medical center; their conditions are unknown.The campus chapter of the Delta Chi fraternity has confirmed to local media outlets that the three wounded victims were all members. It is unclear if the alleged gunman or the deceased victim had any involvement in Greek life.According to authorities, the shooting occurred in a campus parking lot near the Mountain View residence hall located on the north-east end of the Flagstaff campus around 1.20 am local time.Northern Arizona University officials said campus police had the suspect in custody within two minutes of first word of the incident.A statement released by the university said NAU police were notified at 1.20am of shots fired and that the suspect was detained and the situation secured at 1.22am.The statement did not say what was going on at the shooting scene when police arrived.Emergency medical personnel were on the scene a 1.33am.Fowler said police do not know what the argument was about, but at some point Jones opened fire with a handgun. The suspect stopped shooting and submitted to officers when they arrived on the scene, Fowler said. He is cooperating with police.Fowler said the victims, all male freshmen, sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Mountain View Hall houses campus students involved in fraternities and sororities  the university societies named after Greek letters meant to provide students with a family-like support system.A lockdown on the campus was lifted after the suspected gunman was taken into custody. One of three public universities in the state, NAU has more than 25,000 total undergraduates.Arizona governor Doug Ducey offered his condolences to the victims in a statement.This heartbreaking incident will impact many of our fellow citizens, and I ask all Arizonans to keep them and the family of the individual lost in their thoughts and prayers as they cope with this tragedy, Ducey said.Barack Obama is visiting Roseburg on Friday to meet the victims of the shooting there, in which a gunman killed nine people and himself.The Washington Post reported that the president was considering executive action to impose new background-check requirements for buyers who purchase weapons from high-volume gun dealers, citing an anonymous senior administration official.Referring to those in Roseburg who object to Obama¡¦s focus on gun control since the shooting, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said: ¡§Those individuals have nothing to fear. The fact is the president has made clear that the goal of his visit is to spend time with the families of those who are so deeply affected by this terrible tragedy.¡¨",10
